# A hands on workshop

We had a discussion at the August 2024 meeting that it would be nice to have a hands on workshop to do "something" different. This is the initial cut at a workshop, and being the ambitious type, I have made it somewhat modular and in multiple sections so we can progress as a group. If we don't get very far, it can continue on meeting nights, as everybody will be at the same place - at least that is the plan.

## What are we doing?

Great question! We are going to resurrect some idle hardware, specifically a Raspberry Pi 3 model B and use it for an embedded function. Details will be posted as we work through it. The first one will be September 14, 2024 at an in person event. Details to follow on the location. For those not in reasonable access distance, there will be a call with everyone participating.

A short outline is:
- Do not use the keyboard and monitor for the project
- Configure your Pi to be serial accessible (and network eventually) using a Linux system
- Convert the Pi to boot over USB instead of the microSD card
- Install a different OS than usual on the USB device
- Add necessary packages to install docker or podman (need to see how that will work)
- Build a container to run as a service
- Turn the Pi into a kiosk system that accesses the container data

That's the initial list. Depending on the enthusiasm levels, it can continue into additional functionality. There are a lot of additional things to add here if the interest is there

## What do I need to get started?

See the parts.adoc file. It has a little information and a list of parts. You do not need them all. I tried to cover what people may need to get if they do not have it already.

## Will there be instructions?

Absolutely. They will be uploaded for each section as we get to it. I don't want people jumping too far ahead as there are many ways to mess it up.
